## Free games

- Vampire Survivors - Wave survival game in a charming artstyle. Only has ads to facilitate second chance mechanics
- DATA WING - A arcade geometry sci-fi racing game. You race by drifting and gain speed by wall-riding as you complete time-based challenges 
- UnCiv - A retro themed demake of Sid Meiers' Civilisation with a surprising amount of features, including multiplayer 
- Gamestart Pixel Battle - A pixel-art level-based 2d platformer with bosses and multiple characters

## Paid games

- Dead Cells - A platforming rogue-like loved by many. 
- Mini Metro - Subway system design simulator
